## Short Promotional Post

Still rewriting PM prompts and getting generic AI output? That is not a workflow. That is Groundhog Day with worse formatting.

I built a reusable PM Skills repo to help you make sharper decisions, cleaner docs, and better outcomes faster.

After 20 years in Product Management, and 15 years before that as a software engineer, my mission now is simple: send the ladder down.

I am proud of the work I have done over the last 3.5 years at Productside.com, and genuinely excited to share this.

Two years ago I published:
[my prompting repo](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts)

Now I am excited to share:
[Product Manager Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)

If you are done with one-off prompting and ready for repeatable execution, this is for you.

Still rewriting PM prompts and getting generic AI output?
That is not AI leverage. That is prompt roulette.

I built a reusable PM Skills repo to help PMs make sharper decisions, clearer docs, and better outcomes:
[Product Manager Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)

After 20 years in Product Management, and 15 years before that as a software engineer, I have seen this pattern over and over:
smart PMs, weak systems.

They are not failing because they are lazy or untalented.
They are failing because most PM guidance is either too fluffy, too academic, or too vague to use on Tuesday morning before a roadmap meeting.

I came into PM through the technical route. That gave me one unfair advantage:
I care less about pretty theories and more about whether the thing actually works in the wild.

Today, my mission is simple: send the ladder down to the next generation of PMs.

That is why I am proud of the work I have done over the last 3.5 years at Productside.com, and why this repo matters to me.

This has evolved in clear versions:

- **v0.05 (February 1, 2026)** was rooted in **my prompting repo** and my early chatbot workflow work with Claude:  
  [Product Manager Prompts](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts)
- **v0.1 (February 4, 2026)** was based on **my selected Substack posts**, with a Claude-first drafting pass and then Codex finalization/testing to make it pass muster for distribution in skills markets:  
  [Dean Peters Substack](https://deanpeters.substack.com/)
- **v0.2 (February 8, 2026)** was **inspired** by the kinds of metrics we teach in Productside's Optimal Product Management and Digital Product Management courses, plus the "build-a-whatever" and "test-a-whatever" style group activities/templates we teach in AI Product Management class. Same approach: Claude sketches/drafts, Codex finalizes/tests, and holds it to strict published standards:  
  [Productside Product Management Courses](https://productside.com/product-management-courses/)

Prompts are useful.  
But prompts are usually one-off sugar highs.  
Skills are reusable operating systems.

The Product Manager Skills repo helps PMs and AI agents work with repeatable structure:

- Component skills for key artifacts
- Interactive skills for guided decision-making
- Workflow skills for end-to-end execution

If you are trying to move from generic AI mush to consistent, practical, professional outcomes, this is for you.

If you are an experienced PM, I would value your feedback and your pushback.  
If you are early in your journey, I hope this helps you skip some pain and ship better work faster.

No hype. No PM cosplay. Just frameworks that work.
